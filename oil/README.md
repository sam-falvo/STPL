# Oberon-07 Inspired Language

OIL is a fork of Oberon-07, if you will, tailored to the task of helping me
write system software for the Kestrel-3 home-made computer.

I start with the Oberon-07 language report as a basis, and will implement
required changes to the language on an as-needed basis.  I will introduce my
own language report only after I require changing the language proper.
